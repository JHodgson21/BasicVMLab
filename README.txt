Create a README.txt text file that describes how to use your application from the command line.  The grader should not need any information outside of your README to understand how to launch and use your application.  
Make sure you note here if the programming language you used for the project requires some prerequisites to be installed ahead of time in order for your project to run. 
In addition to README, also submit your meeting reports from this sprint.
