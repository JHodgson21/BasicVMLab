Overview: 
The UVSim is a simple virtual machine desgined to execture programs written in BasicML machine language. This README file will provide the reader with all the instructions needed to use the UVSim from the command line. 

 

Prerequisites: 
Before running the UVSim, make sure that you have Python Installed on your system. The UVSim that we created was created using Python Version 3.8.10 

 

Installation: 
1. Clone the UVSim repository from GitHub 
2. Open your computer's command line interface
3. Type in the following: git clone https://github.com/JHodgson21/CS-2450-Group-Project.git 
4. This link is important because here you will be able to obtain the UVSim codebase from our GitHub. By cloning the repository you’ll be able to access the source code and run the program on your own computer.  
5. Navigate to the project directory if needed (cd CS-2450-Group-Project) 

 

Usage: 
To run the UVSim follow these steps: 
1. Open a “Command Prompt” on Windows or a “Terminal” on macOS/Linux. 
2. Once the command prompt is open, go to the directory where you saved the UVSim repository using the ‘cd’ command.  
Example:  
cd  \Users\Jakob\Desktop\2024 Software Engineering Project\CS-2450-Group-Project 

3. Make a txt file for commands to be used in the UVSIM. If you are on Windows search for notepad. If you are on macOS you will be using TextEdit, or you can use any other text editor you like.  
4. Writing to your program (to the UVSIM): In the text editor write your program using the commands supported by the UVSIM. Each command should be written on a separate line.  
5. Save the file in the same location where the UVSIM is saved. (also make sure its a .txt file).  

Example of a .txt file 

+1007 
+1008 
+2007 
+3008 
+2109 
+1109 
+4300 


This txt file explained
‘+1007’: This is a READ operation. It prompts the user to input an integer and stores it in memory to location 07 
‘+1008’: This is a READ operation. It prompts the user to input an integer and stores it in memory to location 08 
‘+2007’: This is a LOAD operation. It loads the value stored in memory location 07 into the accumulator 
‘+3008’: This instruction is an ADD operation. It adds the value stored in memory location 08 to the value currently in the accumulator 
‘+2109’: This instruction is a STORE operation. It stores the value currently in the accumulator into memory location 09. 
‘+1109’: This instruction is a WRITE operation. It will write or output the value stored in memory location 09. 
‘+4300’: This instruction is a HALT operation. It will halt the program, indicating to the computer that the program has finished running.  


Run the UVSim application using Python, providing a test file as a command-line argument, example below. 
python UVSIM.py (yourfile.txt) 

After running the above command (provided that your txt file is same as the one I provided in the example above.). You’ll get a prompt to enter a number. Enter a number. You’ll then be prompted again to enter another number. Enter a second number. After entering the second number the UVSim will show you the sum of those two numbers. 

 

How the BasicML vocabulary works within the UVSim.  

BasicML vocabulary defined as follows: 

I/O operation: 
READ = 10 Read a word from the keyboard into a specific location in memory. 
WRITE = 11 Write a word from a specific location in memory to screen. 

Load/store operations: 
LOAD = 20 Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator. 
STORE = 21 Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory. 

Arithmetic operation: 
ADD = 30 Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator) 
SUBTRACT = 31 Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator) 
DIVIDE = 32 Divide the word in the accumulator by a word from a specific location in memory (leave the result in the accumulator). 
MULTIPLY = 33 multiply a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator). 

Control operation: 
BRANCH = 40 Branch to a specific location in memory 
BRANCHNEG = 41 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative. 
BRANCHZERO = 42 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero. 
HALT = 43 Stop the program
