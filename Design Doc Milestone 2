Description: 

The UVSim is a simple virtual machine that executes programs written in BasicML machine language.  

 

User Stories: 

(User Story 1) 

As a UVSim developer 

I want to load and execute BasicML programs on the UVSim 

So that I can learn how machine language works and become more familiar with computer architecture.  

 

(User Story 2) 

As a client 

I want a UVSim for my students to learn machine language 

So that they can gain a deeper understanding of low-level programming concepts. 

 
(User Story 3)
As an end-user

I want to create a UVSim file that includes machine language instructions

So that functionality can be tested in a safe environment.


(User Story 4) 
As a UVSim stakeholder

I want to verify that the program ignores incorrect files

So that the program succeeds with integrity and security.



Use Cases:  

#1 Load Program 

Description: This use case describes the process of loading a BasicML program into the UVSim memory starting at location 00 

Actors: Student  

System: UVSim 

Goal: Load a BasicML program in the UVSim memory starting at location 00 


#2 I/O Read 
Description: The program includes functionality to read a word from the keyboard and store it in a specified memory location.
Actors: Student
System: UVSim
Goal: Read a word from the keyboard into a specific location in memory.

#3 I/O Write
Description: The program can write a word from specific memory locations to the screen.
Actors: Student
System: UVSim
Goal: Write a word from a specific location in memory to the screen.

#4 Load Operations
Description: The program can load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.
Actors: Student
System: UVSim
Goal: Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.
 

Steps: 

Student inputs the BasicML program into UVSim 

The UVSim reads the input (a signed four-digit number) 

The UVSim stores each instruction into consecutive memory slots 

The UVSim validates that the program fits in the memory and that the instructions are valid instructions. 

The UVSim confirms to the user that the program loaded successfully
