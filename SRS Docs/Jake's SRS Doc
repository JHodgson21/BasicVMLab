Software Requirement Specification Document 

For UVSim 


Functional Requirements

1. The system will allow users to load a program into memory. 

2. The system will validate that each instruction in the program is a valid BasicML instruction 

3. The system will display an error message if an invalid instruction is used during loading.  

4. The system will fetch instructions from memory in the sequence it was given. 

5. The system will decode and execute the fetched instruction. 

6. The system will support the following BasicML instructions: READ, WRITE, LOAD, STORE, ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, BRANCH, BRANCHNEG, BRANCHZERO, HALT. 

7. The system will prompt the user to enter an integer when executing the READ instruction. 

8. The system will output the value stored in the specified memory slot when executing a WRITE instruction. 

9. The system will add the value from a specified memory location to the accumulator for the ADD instruction. 

10. The system will subtract the value from a specified memory location to the accumulator for the SUBTRACT instruction. 

11. The system will multiply the accumulator by the value from a specified memory location for the MULTIPLY instruction. 

12. The system will divide the accumulator by the value from a specified memory location for the DIVIDE instruction. 

13. The system will set the instruction counter to the specified address for BRANCH instructions. 

14. The system will set the instruction counter to the specified address if the accumulator is negative for BRANCHNEG instructions. 

15. The system shall set the instruction counter to the specified address if the accumulator is zero for BRANCHZERO instructions.  

 

Non-Functional Requirements 

1.The system will execute each instruction within 10 milliseconds to ensure responsive interaction with the user.  

2. The system shall provide clear error messages to help users debug their programs. 

3. The system shall handle unexpected input, ensuring the virtual machine doesnâ€™t crash due to invalid operations.
